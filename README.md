## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- `keras` library
- `tkinter` library (usually included with Python)
- `win32gui` library
- `Pillow` (PIL) library
- `numpy` library

You can install the required Python libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install keras pillow numpy
pip install pywin32  # for win32gui
